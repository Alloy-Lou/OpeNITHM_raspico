# OpeNITHM_raspico
Because OpeNITHM is too cool to be abandonned just because the Teensy LC was discontinued.
This version uses instead a Raspberry Pi Pico and a bunch of MPR121 modules to get the work done.
This repository is intended to be a fool-proof and beginner-friendly guide for the assembly of this build.
This is one of my first DIY projects, so I believe it can be quite accessible with a minimum of technical knowledge.
I made all the mistakes (even the awkward ones) so you don't have to!
As a heads-up, this guide will be written in a casual tone (because why not)

## Disclaimer
This build have very very little testing (I'm the only one to have completed it as far as I know... for now!) so there might be some hidden little issues I haven't encountered yet.
Proceed at your own risk! I'm not responsible for anything that breaks or don't work. (Scary disclaimer but I have to give warnings). If you encounter anything that goes wrong, feel free to open an Issue!

## List of Hardware
If full DIY-ed, this build can be quite cheap to assemble!
Here are the list of items I needed, the (approximate) price I paid to build mine as well as the links to where I bought them:
